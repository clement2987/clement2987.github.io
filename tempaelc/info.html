    <h3>here is a list of domain names I found, let me know which one you like</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>advancedpower.au</li>
        <li>advancedpowerelectricsolar.com.au</li>
        <li>advpelec.com.au</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can search for other domain names here: <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/en-au/offers/domain?isc=sem3year&countryview=1&currencyType=AUD&cdtl=c_17633705936.g_138647902775.k_kwd-10085481.a_720326447653.d_c.ctv_g&bnb=nb&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhr6_BhD4ARIsAH1YdjDU4AKm_mr-W0vS7KxveQouZe2-_Ne8pgxAxgGb5u3NaQNzM_45_p4aAkrbEALw_wcB">go daddy</a>
        we like short domains to help people search for you, but also descriptive names will help people find you on google. we want to aim for ".com.au"
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have other versions of your logo, something designed to be small we can use that for your favicon which will show up on google search results and that sort of thing
        the one you have so far is pretty epic but it has too much detail to look good as a small image
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway let me know what you think, I am happy to make any edits
